# [Day 7: Arrays!]
by saikiran9194

## Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 7! Check out [a video review of arrays here], or just jump
right into the problem.

An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory
locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique
identifier.

You'll be given an array of `N` integers, and you have to print the integers
in reverse order.

Good luck!

## Input Format

The first line of input contains `N`, the number of integers. The next line
contains `N` integers separated by a space.

## Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10000, where *A<sub>i</sub>* is the *i<sup>th</sup>*
integer in the array.

## Output Format

Print the `N` integers of the array in the reverse order on a single line
separated by a space.

## Sample Input

```
4
1 4 3 2
```

## Sample Output

```
2 3 4 1
```
